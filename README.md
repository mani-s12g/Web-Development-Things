# Web-Development-Things
Here i upload whatever i learned like it may be small project or big project as i progress with my studies.

To-Do Application

Descrition of App:

*This is todo application which i done  using Basic Web development technologies like HTML, CSS and Javascript.
*Its basically a to-do list which keeps record of all of your activities which you want to do in future.
*Its a simple basic application of To do list
*HTML is used for basically to write the content of page like what things one need to show to the user, like in this case very simple to 
enter the entry of users and to take the input from the user the Add button 
*CSS will take care of all the look and feel of UI(User Interface)
*Javascript used to add Functionalities to the Button and when the user inputs the data a pop up of his entry will appear on screen
and user will be able to see what he has entered, and there is one cancel button over the left of the user entry which when pressed 
the user data will disapper from the list of entries. So all of these fuctionalities are taken care by Javascript.

Room for improvement:

*If want we can use "Django Framework" and add Database which helps the admin to store all user data.
*Easy to learn and implement
*There is good space for improvement in this project if we want we can implement the same with more 
functionalities like creating user login page,signip page and logout page.
*And using CSS one can make this page look good and more appealing to the user.
